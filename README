FILE DESCRIPTION
=================

lab1b-client.c:     a program that opens a connection to the server through a --port command.
                    includes two other flags such as --log which takes in a log file as a
                    parameter and logs every output post-compression and every input pre-
                    decompression. also accepts --compress which uses zlib to compress data
                    sent between client and server.

lab1b-server.c:     a program that will connect with the client, receive client's commands, and
                    relay them to a shell for processing before returning the results back to the
                    client. has a --port command which opens the server on that port for listening
                    as well as a --compress command which decompresses input and compresses output
                    using zlib

Makefile:           the project's Makefile. supports 5 targets including 1 default
                    make default: builds the code. requires lab1b-client.c and lab1b-server.c
                                    to exist.
                    make client: builds lab1b-client.c and requires lab1b-client.c to exist
                    make server: builds lab1b-server.c and requires lab1b-server.c to exist
                    make dist: creates the tarball file that includes all necessary
                                files to submit.
                    make clean: cleans the code of all files created by the make
                                file such as tarball, lab1b executables, etc.
